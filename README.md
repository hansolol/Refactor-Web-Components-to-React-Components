# Refactor-Web-Components-to-React-Components
## Description
This is a practice in refactoring a page with web components to react components. The changes I made are as follows: The Movie component is divided into smaller components like MovieHeader, MovieContent, MovieInfo, and InfoSection. Each component focuses on a specific part of the movie card. The Movie component passes the necessary props down to its child components to make the code more organized and easier to understand. The use of template literals is used for generating the movieStyle object.
## How to Run
Download files, start a http-server on your terminal, and load index.html.
